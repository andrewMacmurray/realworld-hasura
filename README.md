## What?

A Realworld inspired blogging platform using `Hasura` + `Purescript` + `Elm`

'Inspired' as it doesn't follow the frontend or backend spec for the official `Realworld` example apps (https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) but tries to replicate the features as closely as possible.

### Some notable differences to reference Realworld

- Uses a Graphql Backend (Hasura https://hasura.io/)
- Frontend uses Elm UI for layout (https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/)
- Mobile responsive
- Modified Layout and design

## Why?

Why not? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüê≤ I wanted to try out Hasura on a 'real' project and combine it with a number of nice patterns and techniques I've been using in Elm on a work project.

## How?

The project is a monorepo split into `frontend`, `backend` (separate READMEs in each directory)

### Frontend

- A single page Elm app (deployed on `vercel` https://vercel.com)

### Backend

- A Hasura instance is deployed on Heroku
- A `Purescript` serverless http api that handles authentication and custom application logic, communicates with Hasura as an actions server https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/actions/index.html (deployed on `vercel`)

### Github Actions (CI/CD/Infra)

- Automated tests run on each pull request
- A full build and deploy of each service happens on merge to `main`
